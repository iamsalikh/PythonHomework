# 1. Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.
side = 4
p = 4 * side
print(p)

# 2. Given diameter of circle. Find its length.
diameter = 10
pi = 3.14
length = diameter * pi
print(length)

# 3. Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.
a = 50
b = 3
mean = (a + b) / 2
print(mean)

# 4. Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.
a = 5
b = 5
sum = a + b
product = a * b
square_a = a**2
square_b = b**2
print(sum, product, square_a, square_b)
